# DANN
Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) in Keras

The domain adversarial Neural Networks are vastly used for classification and recognition tasks in which the input data can be out-of-domain compared to the original training data. The algorithm, presented in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07818">this paper</a>, is implemented in Keras.
The presented Keras code allows flexible structure of the network by simply adjusting the "dann_helper" and different visualization and model manipulation such as visualization of model structure as seen in the image below:
